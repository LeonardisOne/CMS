# CMS




### 1.Front end team:
Work with templates files in the templates folder as well as the css file in the static folder. You guys can consider using bootstrap.

### 2. View:
Work closely with the front end team. Creating views to handle request sent by the browser. Work mainly with the ``views.py`` file.

### 3.Model (Database):
Work closely with whoever in charge of views. Create models (classes as learnt in database course) using the ``models.py`` file.

### 4.Authentication (User):
Develope users and users groups with different privileges. Will work with both the view and the front end team.

### 5. Push you changes on github
**Please** don't use ``git push -u origin master``. I will find you and I will kill you. Please check out using another branch first, ideally the name of the branch would be your name or your team name. Commit message should be somewhat meaningful of the changes you commit.

	git checkout -b [name_of_new_branch] 
	git commit -m [message]
	git push origin [name_of_new_branch]
